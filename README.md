## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create a fully responsive website with a navigation bar, a hero section with a background image and text overlay, and a grid of four cards. Each card contains an image, title, and description, and rearranges itself based on the screen size. A simple interactive feature (e.g., a modal or smooth scroll) is implemented using Vanilla JavaScript.

## Features
- **Responsive Navigation Bar**: Adjusts its layout based on screen size.
- **Hero Section**: Includes a background image with a text overlay.
- **Card Grid Layout**: Four cards that rearrange themselves based on the screen size using CSS Grid and Flexbox.
- **Mobile-First Approach**: The page is optimized for different screen sizes (from mobile to desktop) using media queries.
- **Vanilla JavaScript Interaction**: Includes a simple interaction like a modal window or smooth scrolling.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: For the website's structure.
- **CSS3**: For styling the website, with Flexbox and Grid used for the layout.
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: For adding interactive features (such as smooth scroll or modal).
